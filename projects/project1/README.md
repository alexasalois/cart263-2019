Modern Day Sisyphus

For this assignment, we had to develop an interactive experience to showcase the story of Sisyphus. This tale is absolute
an infinite task, giving you the impression of progress when you're actually just stuck in a never ending loop forever.
I had a bit of trouble finding inspiration for the theme of my project, and I built on that frustration of not knowing what
to do, and trying to get used to a new coding language. Being stuck without inspiration and needing to do work that requires
creativity is super difficult, since you only have a certain number of days and during a mental block, it just creates a whole
lot of anxiety around "Why can't I come up with good ideas? Am I not creative enough? What if my work comes out really bad?":
I wanted to show this feeling of being unsatisfied with your work when facing the harsh reality of artistic mitigation. Indeed,
in my game, the objective is to finish your assignment avoiding all typos, coming up with good ideas and interesting visuals,
including compelling interactions and writing various lines of code, yet more work piles up every time you think you've finished
your project. I chose those 5 components according to my own struggles, as these are my main concerns when creating an assignment.
The initial values are what I determined to be the important parts when setting up the objects, for instance the highest one is for
the lines in the script, which go up pretty fast if you're doing the work. The second highest one is avoiding typos, since your
code won't run properly if it's full of mistakes. Then you have the aesthetic factor to the game, followed by the interesting
concepts for the game, and lastly the meaningful interactions, which I thought were dependent on the above factors. I decided to
keep the colors of the game very basic, just black, white and red text for the assignment pop-up window, since it is supposed to
be a game about a repetitive, almost sleepy experience of continuously trying and failing to finish. The screen starts to look
bland to you the more the game "progresses". As for the sound, I added a simple typing effect for the person writing on the computer,
another sleepy aspect, almost like "ASMR". I decided to loop some background music that was like a "chill lo-fi" beat, something
that most of us listen to when trying to speed through various assignments left undone too close to their due date. I also thought
that the song being a remix of the Super Mario World "Game Over" music was fun, since the "game over" usually means either you stop
playing and go back to your usual tasks, or you have to start the same thing over and over until it's done, which plays (ha)
nicely with the theme of Sisyphus and the torturous never-ending task. Improving my programming skills and being creative isn't
the punishment, but leaving things last minute and having work pile up and force you to shoot out bad wannabe-creative ideas
is the agonizing infinite consequence.
