The Power of Words
by Alexandra Salois

For my project 2, after reading the Essay, my vision was to create something that had an innocent and pure appearance to appeal
children, but it suddenly goes dark after a while of playing. In fact, the avatar, the word and the overall aesthetics change,
as it shows the obscure aspect of click bait children's entertainment. First of all, I decided to go with a blue background since
it is usually associated with the concept of heaven, and also calmness, peace and serenity. When it turns suddenly obscure, the
background becomes a deep red with trippy circles acting almost like an optical illusion, the "rings of hell". The contrast
between the colours also makes it easy to differentiate between the innocent and the dark. The main character of the game is also
rocking some cute "space buns", which is usually associated to a child's adorable and sweet hairstyle, therefore it felt appropriate
to also change the appearance of the avatar to suddenly make it not so appropriate for young players, as she hold a large bloody
knife, with blood shot eyes and messy hair. The array of words to guess also changes depending on the happiness state of the game.
When the game is hiding behind a happy facade, it gives you nice pleasing words such as cupcakes, family, friendship and kitten.
When it goes dark, the words drastically change to very serious and scary words for children, such as death, torture, suicide and
cunt, which are all definitely not appropriate for a young player. The concept of the game is fairly easy, since it's meant to
be for kids who could be attracted to the adorable aesthetic and simple instructions. I got the inspiration for this game by watching
many "Doki-Doki Literature Club" playthroughs, which is a game that represents deceiving appearance extremely well: it looks like
a cute dating simulator, but it ends up being an interactive psychological horror game. It has cute visuals and nicely drawn characters
but these quickly become eerie as the design is modified throughout the storyline to be more unsettling, such as blacked out eyes,
glitchy movement, and very inappropriate dialog with swears and extremely dark topics such as mutilation, suicide and manipulation.
This was a concept that I wanted to use in my game, as you want to win the game and score as many points as possible but there is no
actual ending to the game. The more you try to gain more points, the more the darkness is thrown at you, and affects your thoughts and
ideas. Being repeatedly exposed to inappropriate content at such a young age can be quite damaging to a child's mind and a traumatizing
event. That's why I also added a monotone voice over, reading out the words, and his tone does not change even though the terms become
very dark: he is unaffected by the inappropriate events, and it creates a very unsettling calmness to the game. These creepy creators
on the Internet are putting out this content with the objective of scaring young viewers, and so with my game, I wanted to represent
the contrast of deceiving appearances and shocking content, how words can be an extremely powerful tool when it comes to shaping young
minds.
